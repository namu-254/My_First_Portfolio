    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>

    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>
        This webpage is part of my HTML basics project. I am learning how to structure a page using different HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, and links.
    </p>

    <h3>My Learning Journey</h3>
    <p>
        Every day I continue to grow my skills in coding and web development. This project helps me understand how HTML works and how webpages are built.
    </p>

    <p>
        I enjoy experimenting with different tags and elements. HTML allows me to control content structure and make webpages readable and organized.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is just the beginning of my journey, and I’m excited to keep learning more advanced web technologies in the future.
