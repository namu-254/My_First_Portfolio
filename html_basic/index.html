  <h1>Welcome — My First Cool Webpage</h1>

  <h2>About This Page</h2>
  <p>
    This page is my ALX submission for "Make a cool first webpage".
    It demonstrates basic HTML structure and correct file placement.
  </p>

  <h3>Why I'm learning HTML</h3>
  <p>
    Learning HTML helps me create and structure web content — it's the first step to becoming a web developer.
  </p>

  <p>
    I practice by making small pages, experimenting with headings, paragraphs, and images.
  </p>

  <p>
    This specific page contains the required headings, at least four paragraphs, and a clickable image.
  </p>

  <h2>Clickable Image (required)</h2>
