    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>

    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>
        This webpage is part of my HTML basics project from My_First_Portfolio. 
        It includes headings, paragraphs, and a clickable image as required.
    </p>

    <h3>Learning HTML</h3>
    <p>
        Through this project, I am learning how to structure webpages using HTML elements.
        Headings help organize content, while paragraphs provide readable text.
    </p>

    <p>
        Creating a webpage from scratch helps me understand how tags work and how browsers display content.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is my first step into web development, and I am excited to continue learning more.
